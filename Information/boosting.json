    "summary": "Boosting is a technique in Machine Learning that improves predictive accuracy by combining multiple weak learners.",
    "content": "Weak learners are models that are only slightly better than random guessing. So, they alone can not be used. However, if we take a series of weak learners and train them sequentially, in such a way that each learner is trained on its predecessors error, each of them will progressively generate less error at overall level. So the final model can perform quite well eventually.",
