{"title": "Bagging - Bootstrap Aggregation", "summary": "Bagging, is a machine learning ensemble method used to enhance the performance and stability of predictive models by training multiple models on different subsets of the training data and then combining their predictions.", "content": "Bagging involves creating multiple \"bootstrap samples\" from the original training data. A bootstrap sample is a random subset of the data, selected with replacement, meaning that some data points may appear multiple times in a single sample. Each bootstrap sample is used to train a separate base model. Finally the predictions of each such base model are combined to generate final prediction. This process in most cases reduces variance and over-fitting and improves accuracy.", "tags": ["Bagging", "Breimen", "Random Forest"], "resources": [{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_aggregating", "name": "Bagging Wikipedia"}], "last_updated": "Today"}
